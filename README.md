libdi
=====

A small PHP library for submitting leads to DI.

This is severely untested as-is and needs work. Test thoroughly!

Features in Brief
-----------------
* Easily run muliple campaigns out of a single directory, if desired
* XML sanitization is automagically done to all form fields
* Phone numbers are required to have 7 or more digits, and are stripped of formatting automagically
* DI credentials are kept in a config file; easily updated with FTP
* Single call library; even developers unversed in DI's API can quickly get a form set up
